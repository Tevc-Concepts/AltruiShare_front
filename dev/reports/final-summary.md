## 2. How to Run Locally
1. Install deps: `npm ci`
2. Development: `npm run dev`
3. Tests: `npm test`
4. Type check: `npm run type-check`
5. Lint: `npm run lint`
6. Production build: `npm run build`
7. Start prod: `npm start -p 3000`

Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` should point to backend (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/method/altruishare`).

## 3. Implemented Features Overview
- Marketing landing page (hero, feature grid, role spotlight modal, capability matrix).
- Authentication & role-based gating with guest preview; `Protected` component enforces access.
- API layer with axios client + response envelope normalization.
- UI design system primitives: Button, Card (header/content/title), Badge, Input; Tailwind tokens (gradients, shadows, semantic colors).
- Impact dashboard with Recharts (KPI cards, area + pie charts).
- Notifications panel + offline action queue with automatic flush on reconnect.
- Offline readiness: `/offline` fallback route (Edge runtime), `useOnlineStatus` hook, `OfflineBanner` live connectivity indicator.
- PWA service worker (next-pwa) auto-registration.
- Accessibility: skip link, focus tests, basic a11y verifications in layout & pages.

## 4. Consumed / Mapped API Endpoints
Refer to `dev/reports/api-map.md` for table.

Endpoints actively touched or scaffolded:
- Auth: login, logout, register, get_logged_user, ping
- Roles: get_user_roles (fetch attempted; unauthenticated returns none in examples)
- Needs: list/filter (UI stub/gating prepared)
- Donations: list/create (feature tests scaffold)
- Impact: get_impact_analytics (dashboard hook + charts)
- Notifications: list, mark_read, mark_all_read (panel + queue)
- Files: upload (upload demo page / component)
- Payments & Volunteers: mapped, not yet integrated in UI flows

## 5. Sample API Responses
See `dev/reports/api-examples.json` â€” includes ping success and placeholder for roles (needs authenticated session).

## 6. Testing & Quality
- Jest suites: 24; Tests: 87 passing.
- Placeholder Lighthouse report: `dev/reports/lighthouse.json` (real audit pending local Chrome run).
- Lint: All custom code clean; warnings limited to third-party/minified SW assets.
- TypeScript: `npm run type-check` passes during build (SWC + Next build check).

## 7. Pending / TODO Items
| Category | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Performance | Real Lighthouse audit | Replace placeholder; capture metrics baselines |
| Roles | Dynamic capability matrix | Drive from roles endpoint once backend finalized |
| Roles | Role request workflow UI | Form + endpoint integration |
| Offline | Automatic redirect to `/offline` | Router listener or middleware on network loss |
| Impact | Refine chart container sizing warnings | Provide fixed min dimensions or layout effect |
| Payments | Integrate payment request & verification | Add donation flow extension |
| Volunteers | Build volunteer opportunity listing & hours logging | Requires endpoint confirmation |
| Notifications | Mark-all-read & optimistic read state tests | Partial coverage exists |
| Internationalization | Enable `next-intl` i18n scaffolding | Base config pending |
| Accessibility | Additional WCAG audit (keyboard trap, color contrast) | After design refinements |

## 8. Known Warnings (Test/Console)
- Recharts zero-dimension warnings in jsdom (non-breaking; container sizing in tests).
- Layout tests: nested `<html>` hydration warning due to rendering RootLayout directly.
- jsdom network errors when attempting real XHR to backend during unauthenticated role fetch (caught, not failing tests).

## 9. Suggested Next Steps
1. Run real Lighthouse and update `lighthouse.json`.
2. Implement offline navigation guard (redirect + queued route restore).
3. Add dynamic role-capability data fetch and surface missing capabilities request CTA.
4. Introduce payment flow UI integrating payment request & verification endpoints.
5. Harden a11y with additional automated tooling (axe) and contrast tokens.

## 10. Change Log Impact Summary
- Footprint: First load JS ~102 kB shared; impact page dynamic bundle larger due to charts (opt-in code splitting potential).
- Edge runtime isolated to `/offline` page only.
- No introduction of legacy Babel; SWC-only pipeline maintained.
